## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:
My code seemed clean and nothing needed to be previously cleaned up

Summary of function(s) added:
The first function I added drew a flower, and my larger and interactive functions worked together in order to work like an online calculator which takes a degree and translates it to a radian

Summary of Feature Added:
I wanted to incorporate code that can interact with the user. The first part of the code is me giving the user a rose so that they have a good time using my code. Then the degree to radian "calculator" comes up and the user can select what degree they want to convert to as well as for whichever trigonometric identity they would like. Lastly, if the user would like to see what these curves look like and get a visual representation of the trig identities they can. Once again I allow the user to enter the colors of everything that is being drawn in order to allow them to see everything well.
